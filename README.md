<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Protify is an open source platform designed to simplify and democratize workflows for chemical language models. With Protify, deep learning models can be trained to predict chemical properties at the click of a button, without requiring extensive coding knowledge or computational resources.

### Why Protify?

- **Benchmark multiple models efficiently**: Need to evaluate 10 different protein language models against 15 diverse datasets with publication-ready figures? Protify makes this possible without writing a single line of code.
- **Flexible for all skill levels**: Build custom pipelines with code or use our no-code interface depending on your needs and expertise.
- **Accessible computing**: No GPU? No problem. Synthyra offers precomputed embeddings for many popular datasets, which Protify can download for analysis with scikit-learn on your laptop.
- **Cost-effective solutions**: The upcoming Synthyra API integration will offer affordable GPU training options, while our Colab notebook provides an accessible entry point for GPU-reliant analysis.

Protify is currently in beta. We're actively working to enhance features and documentation to meet our ambitious goals.

## Usage

<details>
  <summary>Toggle </summary><br />
  
  To launch the gui, run
  
  ```console
  python -m gui
  ```
  
  It's recommended to use the user interface alongside an open terminal, as helpful messages and progressbars will show in the terminal while you press the GUI buttons.
  
  ### An example workflow
  
  Here, we will compare various protein models against a random vector baseline (negative control) and random transformer (homology based control).
  
  1.) Start the session
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/1.PNG">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/2.PNG" width="500">
  
  2.) Select the models you would like to benchmark
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/3.PNG" width="500">
  
  3.) Select the datasets you are interested in. Here we chose Enzynme Comission numbers (multi-label classification), metal-ion binding (binary classificaiton), solubility (deeploc2, binary classification), and catalytic rate (kcat, regression).
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/4.PNG" width="500">
  
  4.) Embed the proteins in the selected datasets. If your machine does not have a GPU, you can download precomputed embeddings for many common sequences.
    Note: If you download embeddings, it will be faster to use the scikit model tab than the probe tab
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/5.PNG" width="500">
  
  5.) Select which probe and configuration you would like. Here, we will use a simple linear probe, a type neural network. It is the **fastest** (by a large margin) but worst performing option (by a small margin usually).
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/6.PNG" width="500">
  
  6.) Select your settings for training. Like most of the tabs, the defaults are pretty good. If you need information about what setting does what, the `?` button provides a helpful note. The documentations has more extensive information
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/7.PNG" width="500">
  
  This will train your models!
  
  7.) After training, you can render helpful visualizations by passing the log ID from before. If you forget it, you can look for the file generated in the `logs` folder.
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/8.PNG" width="500">
  
  Here's a sample of the many plots produced. You can find them all inside `plots/your_log_id/*`
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/9.png" width="500">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/10.png" width="500">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/11.png" width="500">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/13.png" width="500">

  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/12.png" width="500">
  
  8.) Need to replicate your findings for a report or paper? Just input the generated log into the replay tab
  
  <img src="https://github.com/Synthyra/Protify/blob/main/images/example_workflow/14.PNG" width="500">

  To run the same session from the command line instead, you would simply execute
  ```
  python -m main --model_names ESM2-8 ESM2-35 ESMC-300 Random Random-Transformer --data_names EC DeepLoc-2 enzyme-kcat --patience 3
  ```
  Or, set up a yaml file with your desired settings (so you don't have to type out everything in the CLI)
  ```
  python -m main --yaml_path yamls/your_custom_yaml_path.yaml
  ```
  Replaying from the CLI is just as simple
  ```
  python -m main --replay_path logs/your_log_id.txt
  ```
